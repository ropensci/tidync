Title: A Tidy Approach to 'NetCDF' Data Exploration and Extraction
Version: 0.0.3
Authors@R: c(person("Michael", "Sumner", email = "mdsumner@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")), 
             person("Simon", "Wotherspoon", role = "ctb"), 
             person("Tomas", "Remenyi", role = "ctb"), 
             person("Ben", "Raymond", role = "ctb"))
Description: Tidy tools for 'NetCDF' data sources. Explore the contents of a NetCDF source (file or URL) 
 presented as variables organized by grid with a database-like interface. The 'hyper_filter' verb 
 shows the effects of array-slicing expressions by value or index. Actual data read is delayed until explicitly 
 requested, as a data frame or list of arrays.
